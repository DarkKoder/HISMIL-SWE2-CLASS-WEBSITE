3. Git Workflow Guidelines
................................................................................................................................................
Branching Strategy:

Each team will create a separate branch for their part of the project, e.g., home-page, about-page, gallery-page, etc.
Students should never work directly on the main branch. Instead, all work should be done in feature branches.
Commits and Pull Requests:

Make small, frequent commits with clear messages, e.g., Added header section to Home Page.
When a team finishes a feature, they will open a pull request (PR) to merge their branch into main.
Other students should review the PR, suggest changes if necessary, and approve it before merging.
